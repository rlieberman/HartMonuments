		<div class="text"><p>Hart Island is a one mile landform off the east coast of the Bronx, directly adjacent to City Island in Long
		Island Sound. Originally used as a Civil War training, prisoner of war, and then burial location, it was purchased by the City of New York in 1869 and its primary purpose became serving as the final resting place for the indigent and unclaimed dead of the city. Now managed by the Department of Corrections (DOC), Hart Island still fulfills this role, with as many as 1,500 bodies being buried on the island every year by inmates from Riker’s Island.</p><p>Monuments to Hart Island takes into account the island’s present condition, which is to say, nearly inaccessible and hidden in plain sight; you can’t actually go to Hart Island unless you arrange it through the DOC, cameras are not allowed, and unless you are a relative, you can’t visit burial sites (active or inactive).</p><p> We have chosen the format of a virtual reality museum and memorial both to what physically exists on Hart Island and to the barriers faced when trying to encounter what’s there. We have built our 3D reconstruction using photogrammetry from aerial maps, found footage, and our own photography. The experience is enhanced by a series of speculative and abstract memorials designed in 3D modeling software.</p><br/><br/>
